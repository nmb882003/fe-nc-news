## About

NC News Reader is a news content rating and discussion website. It has news articles that are divided into categories. The user can choose to view summaries of all articles or of those in a specific category. Clicking on a summary opens up the article in full, and each article can be up/down voted using the UI. Users can also add comments about an article.

The app is built in React and uses newer features such as functional components, hooks and ReactRouter(v6). Optimistic rendering is also employed where appropriate to improve the user experience. The app was built using responsive design and a mobile-first approach and can be viewed equally well on mobile, tablet and laptop displays.
