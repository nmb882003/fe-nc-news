# NC News Reader

NC News Reader is a news content rating and discussion web app, built during the frontend portion of the Northcoders coding bootcamp (April 2022 cohort). 

The app provides news articles that are divided into categories. The user can choose to view summaries of all articles or of those in a specific category. Clicking on the main title of a summary opens up the article in full, and each article can be voted up or down using the UI. Users can also add comments about an article.
